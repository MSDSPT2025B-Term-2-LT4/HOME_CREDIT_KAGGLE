#### Home Credit Risk Model 

This project aims to develop a binary classification model that is trained on the dataset provided by Home Credit for the [Home Credit Risk Model Stablity competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-credit-risk-model-stability).

Due to the large dataset, it is advised that you run the notebooks in Kaggle as you may run into insufficient RAM or compute errors.

Each phase of the development process was subdivided into 7 notebooks located under the 'kaggle/' folder. Alternatively, you may also run the notebooks in Kaggle:
